<h1>Python: IMAP IDLE with imaplib2</h1>

<p>Had a little fun today trying to get IMAP IDLE from Python working.
It's not in the default imaplib, but
<a href="http://www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~piers/python/imaplib.html">Piers Lauder's imaplib2</a>
has support for it. (I read on another blog that
<a href="http://delx.net.au/blog/2009/02/offlineimap-idle-support/">Piers Lauder is also the writer of imaplib</a>,
so that's kinda nice.)</p>
<p>I don't really program a lot anymore, so I had some trouble trying
	to understand how it's supposed to work.
	Luckily, the blog post that I linked above, also had a link to
	the git sources of offlineimap, which uses it.
	Their <a href="https://delx.net.au/git/offlineimap?a=blob;f=offlineimap/imapserver.py">imapserver.py</a>
	has a nice implementation that I kind of copied.</p>
<p>As a proof of concept, and hopefully so others can use this too, I created
	the script below to see if I could get it to work. It doesn't do a whole
	lot, just print a line when the mailbox gets a new mail. But you can
	build on it from there. I need these kind of examples to get stuff
	like this, so I hope it helps someone else! Leave me a comment if it does.</p>

# This is the threading object that does all the waiting on 
# the event

        self.M = conn

    def start(self):
        self.thread.start()

        # This is a neat trick to make thread end. Took me a 
        # while to figure that one out!
        self.event.set()
 
    def join(self):
        self.thread.join()
 
    def idle(self):
        # Starting an unending loop here
        while True:
            # This is part of the trick to make the loop stop 
            # when the stop() command is given
            if self.event.isSet():
                return

            # A callback method that gets called when a new 
            # email arrives. Very basic, but that's good.
            def callback(args):
                if not self.event.isSet():
                    self.needsync = True
                    self.event.set()
            # Do the actual idle call. This returns immediately, 
            # since it's asynchronous.
            self.M.idle(callback=callback)
            # This waits until the event is set. The event is 
            # set by the callback, when the server 'answers' 
            # the idle call and the callback function gets 
            # called.
            self.event.wait()
            # Because the function sets the needsync variable,
            # this helps escape the loop without doing 
            # anything if the stop() is called. Kinda neat 
            # solution.
            if self.needsync:
                self.event.clear()
                self.dosync()
 
    # The method that gets called when a new email arrives. 
    # Replace it with something better.
    def dosync(self):
        print "Got an event!"
 
# Had to do this stuff in a try-finally, since some testing 
# went a little wrong.....
try:
    # Set the following two lines to your creds and server
    M = imaplib2.IMAP4_SSL("mail.example.com")
    M.login("mylogin","mypassword")
    # We need to get out of the AUTH state, so we just select 
    # the INBOX.
    M.select("INBOX")
    # Start the Idler thread
    idler = Idler(M)
    idler.start()
    # Because this is just an example, exit after 1 minute.
    time.sleep(1*60)
finally:
    # Clean up.
    idler.stop()
    idler.join()
    M.close()
    # This is important!
    M.logout()
